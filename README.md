# Text Statistics Project

* Author: Nick C
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2021

## Overview

ProcessText.java takes in some file arguments and find some interesting statistics about them.
Some example files to test it on are provided.

## Compiling and Using

To use, keep all the files in one directory (this includes the text files you want to test it on).
ProcessText.java is the file you want to run in order to test stuff. It takes some file names
as inputs so you'll want to list those arguments when you run it. It only takes text files at the
moment so be careful about what you throw at the sucker.

## Discussion

Some problems I ran into were not remembering most of the stuff we learned about arrays,
so I spend a good while googling things. Most of what I went through when creating the program
was copying, pasting, and debugging seemingly trivial bits of code. I had to re-teach myself how
arrays and arraylists work, I also had to learn how cli arguments and file reading with java works.
Most of the errors I got were easily avoidable things like missing characters, improper syntax,
forgetting to add stuff, etc. All of those problems were solved with a couple hours of frustration
and a few good night's worth of rest and procrastination before revisiting the project. The most
challenging part of the project was probably the word length things since nobody really had any clue
how it was supposed to work when I asked them over spring break, and I was the only one I could ask
for help since I'm the only comp. sci. nerd in my friend group. I wouldn't say that anything really
"clicked", but knowing that I could easily reuse code that I had previously written made things easier.
If I could change one thing about this project, I would choose to do it in python, a language actually
made for data science/manipulation. Personally, I don't feel like I gained anything from this project,
but I feel like I did cause myself some damage when it comes to being able to socialize or think normally
after working on this thing for so long.

## Testing

To test and make sure everything works, I compared things to the requirements on the BSU project description
page, used testfile.txt as a benchmark file, and made sure to implements the TextStatisticsInterface.java
interfaces in the TextStatistics.java file. I also made sure that the spacing and syntax/capitalization
matched up with the example file so that it's more or less the exact same thing as what you see on the
BSU project webpage. There was also a file available that made it easy-ish to verify that I was on the
right track when building things.
